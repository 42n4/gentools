Gentoo won't show up in the job listings. It's a metadistribution - a tool to
create custom deployments using standard, well-tested packages as components.
It requires in-depth knowledge (not necessarily the way it should be, but it
is a reality) and such knowledge reflects your general knowledge of Linux and
applies to all distributions.

emerge -av1 $(qfile -q -S -C /usr/lib/udev)
%s/-[0-9\.]*[-r0-9]* /-/

vim /usr/share/genkernel/defaults/initrd.defaults
MAKEOPTS="-j8 -l16" genkernel --makeopts=-j9 --lvm --luks --no-clean all;

The  following, in no particular order, are things that require some additional administrative actions, related to maintaining a smooth-running Gentoo install.
Did you emerge anything?

    Let portage clean up lib dependencies.

        emerge -avt1 @preserved-rebuild

    Then let portage prune out old stuff.

        emerge -avt1 --depclean

GCC updated? (sys-devel/gcc)?

    Activate the new profile:

        gcc-config -l

        gcc-config <num>

        env-update && source /etc/profile

        ...where <num> is the latest version.
    libtool needs refreshed:

        emerge -avt1 libtool

    Review the Gentoo wiki page for further details.

Python updated? (dev-lang/python)?

    Verify that the active python version for each slot is updated.

        eselect python list --python2
        eselect python set --python2 <whatever number is the new one>

        eselect python list --python3
        eselect python set -python3 <whatever number is the new one>

    Then allow all the python packages a chance to compile against the new version.

        python-updater -v

PHP updated? (dev-lang/php)?

    Verify that the active php version for each slot is updated.

        eselect php list cli
        eselect php set cli <whatever number is the new one>

        eselect php list apache2
        eselect php set apache2 <whatever number is the new one>

    Then edit /etc/make.conf and ensure PHP_TARGETS reflects the new version.

        python-updater -v

    Review the Gentoo docs page for further details.

Perl updated (dev-lang/perl)?

    Allow all the perl packages a chance to compile against the new version.

        perl-cleaner --all

X11 updated (x11-base/xorg-server)?

    Let the x11 modules update.

        emerge -avt1 @x11-module-rebuild

 Kernel updated (sys-kernel/gentoo-sources)?

    Follow the kernel upgrade guide.

 
Stuck on emerge blockers

Sometimes, if you've not been keeping up with @world and @system updates (or even if you have), things can get a little clogged with portage and it takes some finessing to get everything updated.

If emerge refuses to do anything because it says multiple versions of a given package are being pulled in, try the following:

    Try updating only that package.

        emerge -uavt1 <pkg>

    Try updating that package, but asking emerge to think harder about the dependency tree.

        emerge -uavt1 --backtrack=30 <pkg>

    Or try updating that package and a broader collection of things that depend on it.  Note that this will sometimes work when a simple '-uDavt1 <pkg>' won't.

        equery -Cq depends <pkg> | xargs -d '\n' qlist -IC | xargs -d '\n' emerge -uvt1  <pkg>

    And sometimes (as a last resort) it's possible to just unmerge a troublesome package and then immediately try another @system @world run and let it get pulled back in.
