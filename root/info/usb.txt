Unlike SYSLINUX who installs on FAT formatted drives, EXTLINUX can be used for EXT2/3/4 and even btrfs formatted drives.

EXTLINUX is easier to use than GRUB.

Why use the EXT2 filesystem? It is recommended for flash drives as it is a non-journaled filesystem so the write operations are reduced compared to other journaled filesystems.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext2 for more info.

First operation : partitioning our drive (as root)

This will list the installed physical disk drives in your system :
# fdisk -l

On my particular setup, my USB drive is identified as /dev/sde.

Adapt to your own case.

WARNING! The following will ERASE your USB drive! Be careful not to partition/format the wrong disk drive!

We create an EXT2 partition (whole disk), and mark it as bootable.

sudo parted /dev/sde
mklabel msdos
quit

# fdisk /dev/sde
then enter the following input :

o<ENTER>
n<ENTER>
p<ENTER>
1<ENTER>
<first cylinder, ENTER>
<last cylinder, ENTER>
t<ENTER>
83<ENTER>  <-- partition type : Linux
a<ENTER>
1<ENTER>
w<ENTER>

Partitioning done, next we have to create the filesystem on the drive, on the
/dev/sde1 partition we just created :

# mkfs.ext2 /dev/sde1 -L <label>

<label> is the volume name.

TIP: change a disk label
# tune2fs -L <newlabel> /dev/sde1

Download the latest SYSLINUX/EXTLINUX package (at the time of this writing it was 4.03)

# wget http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/boot/syslinux/syslinux-4.03.tar.bz2
# tar xvjf syslinux*.tar.bz2
# cd syslinux*

Install the MBR on the drive
# cd mbr
# cat mbr.bin >/dev/sde
# dd if=/usr/share/syslinux/mbr.bin of=/dev/sde

Second part, the installation of EXTLINUX bootloader on the drive
First we need to mount the drive (as root)
# mkdir /mnt/usb
# mount /dev/sde1 /mnt/usb

then EXTLINUX
# cd ../extlinux
# extlinux --install /mnt/usb

But we need to create an extlinux.conf file which will contain our bootloader instructions :

# nano /mnt/usb/extlinux.conf

DEFAULT linux
LABEL linux
SAY Now booting the kernel from SYSLINUX...
KERNEL bzImage
#  APPEND ro root=/dev/sde1 initrd=initrd.img

(The APPEND line is commented out in this example.)

But we still need a Linux kernel file (named bzImage above) to copy to this drive!

Why not using your Buildroot-generated kernel? ðŸ™‚

See my other howto here.

All the necessary files have been copied to our USB drive, we can unmount it now.
# cd && umount /mnt/usb

Now you can plug your drive and boot your new system!
